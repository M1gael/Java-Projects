## About
A simple repository where you can see my little projects of interest . These projects serve more as a way to learn java , by using it to build basic versions of apps that could be used in the real world.

## The Projects
### Fibonacci Game
A very over-engineered approach to simply generate a number and have the user guess if it is part of the fibonacci sequence or not. Mainly helped understand how to setup dataflow and use different classes together.
### LoginSystemHashmap 
As the title states , a simple login system that can verify if a user exists and the password is correct ,  if the entered password is wrong , or if the user does not exist. Made use of hashmaps as an easy quick way to store data.
